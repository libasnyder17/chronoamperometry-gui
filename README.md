## chronoamperometry-gui

A MATLAB-based GUI that analyzes chronoamperometry data and helps recommend the best electrolyte for light-based current generation. Designed for use in solar energy and electrochemistry research.

## What It Does

This tool loads `.xlsx` chronoamperometry data, fits it using the Cottrell equation, and provides a recommendation for the most effective electrolyte based on photocurrent performance.

## How to Use

1. Open the file `chronoamperometry_gui_submission.m` in MATLAB.
2. Click **Run** to launch the GUI.
3. Press **"Load .xlsx Data"** and choose your experimental file.
4. View the plot and read the recommended electrolyte type.

## What's Included

- `chronoamperometry_gui_submission.m` – The main MATLAB app
- `.xlsx` – Example data files 
- `README.md` – Project overview 

## Why This Project Matters

This GUI was developed as part of a solar energy research project utilizing biological reaction center proteins interfaced with graphene oxide, a 
conductive material, to generate electric current. The goal is to improve how we test and select electrolytes—the electron carriers between the RC and 
GO—by reducing reliance on trial-and-error methods to optimize photocurrent output.
